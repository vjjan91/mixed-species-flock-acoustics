# Analysis of BirdNET detections

In this script, we carry out spatial and temporal analyses of acoustic detections that were thresholded in the previous script. We work with a subset of detections that have a 95% probability of being a true positive.  

## Load necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)

# for plotting
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
library(colorspace)
library(scico)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(paletteer)
```

## Load acoustic data and metadata
```{r}
metadata <- read.csv("data/acoustic-metadata.csv")
acoustic_data <- read.csv("results/thresholded-acoustic-detections.csv")
```

## Visualizing sampling effort

How much acoustic data was collected? Using information on the first and last date of recorded acoustic data, we could visualize the total recorded days across months and sites.

```{r}
# ensure structure of dates in the metadata file is date
metadata$first_file_date <- as.Date(metadata$first_file_date)
metadata$last_file_date <- as.Date(metadata$last_file_date)

# extract the common start and end dates across sites
# this is to figure out what are periods across which all sites recorded simultaneously
common_start_date <- max(metadata$first_file_date, na.rm = T)
common_end_date <- min(metadata$last_file_date, na.rm = T)

# visualization
fig_samplingEffort <- metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(first_file_date)) %>%

## How much data was recorded at each site?

Creating a bar plot with total number of days of recording at each site. Please refer to the metadata to ascertain the configuration and deployment details for the recorders.
