## Source code for _Using BirdNET to identify mixed-species flocking bird species in the Western Ghats_

This repository was started to document the steps taken to use BirdNET to carry out atuomated identification of thirteen Western Ghats birds that play an important role in a mixed-species flock.    

### [Readable version](https://vjjan91.github.io/mixed-species-flock-acoustics/)

A readable version of this analysis is available in bookdown format by clicking on the heading above.  

The list of 13 species include: 
- Indian White-eye  
- Greenish Warbler  
- Orange Minivet  
- Velvet-fronted Nuthatch  
- Yellow-browed Bulbul  
- Greater Racket-tailed Drongo  
- Ashy Drongo  
- Indian Yellow Tit  
- Green Warbler  
- Large-billed Leaf Warbler  
- Gray-headed Canary-Flycatcher  
- Nilgiri Flycatcher  
- Brown-cheeked Fulvetta  

Using BirdNET Analyzer GUI v2.0.0 and previously written code and steps [here](https://vjjan91.github.io/paired-pointCount-acoustics/exploring-outputs-from-birdnet.html), we use previously set thresholds (except for three species, the Gray-headed Canary-Flycatcher, Nilgiri Flycatcher and Ashy Drongo) to filter all audio detections with a probability of detection of 0.95.
